Java Collections
The collections framework is contained in java.util package defines a set of interfaces and their implementations to manipulate collections, which serve as containers for a group of objects.

The collection framework contains many interfaces such as Collection, Map and Iterator.

The interfaces and their description are mentioned below:

Interface	Description
Collection	collection of elements
List (extends Collection)	sequence of elements
Queue (extends Collection)	the special type of list
Set (extends Collection)	collection of unique elements
SortedSet (extends Set)	sorted collection of unique elements
Map	collection of key and value pairs, which must be unique
SortedMap (extends Map)	sorted collection of key-value pairs
Iterator	an object used to traverse through a collection
List (extends Iterator)	the object used to traverse through a sequence
Classes
The classes available in the collection framework implement the collection interface and sub-interfaces. They also implement Map and Iterator interfaces.

Classes and their Corresponding interfaces are listed :

Class	Interface
AbstractCollection	Collection
AbstarctList	List
Abstract	Queue
AbstractSequentialList	List
LinkedList	List
ArrayList	List, Cloneable and Serializable
AbstractSet	Set
EnumSet	Set
HashSet	Set
